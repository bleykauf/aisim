AISim ‒ Simulations for light-pulse atom interferometry
=======================================================

AISim is a Python package for simulating light-pulse atom
interferometers.

It uses dedicated objects to model the laser beams, the atomic ensemble
and the detection system and store experimental parameters in a neat
way. After you define these objects you can use built-in propagators to
simulate internal and external degrees of freedom of cold atoms.

Installation
------------

The latest tagged release can installed via pip with

    pip install aisim

or via conda with

    conda install -c conda-forge aisim 

Alternatively, if you plan to make changes to the code, use

    git clone https://github.com/bleykauf/aisim.git
    cd aisim
    python setup.py develop

Usage
-----

For basic usage and code reference, see the
[documentation](https://aisim.readthedocs.io).

Examples
--------

Some examples are provided in the form of [Jupyter
notebooks](https://jupyter.org/):
