AISim â€’ Simulations for light-pulse atom interferometry
==========================================================

AISim is a Python package for simulating light-pulse atom
interferometers.

It uses dedicated objects to model the lasers beams, the atomic ensemble
and the detection system and store experimental parameters in a neat
way. After you define these objects you can use built-in propagators to
simulate internal and external degrees of freedom of cold atoms.
